# Health-Satisfaction-Analysis
This portfolio highlights my healthcare data analytics work on a project assessing patient satisfaction using Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey results over the last 9 years (2013-2022). The nationally standardized HCAHPS survey measures patients’ experiences with hospital care across 10 critical domains using a three-level Satisfaction Scale (Always, Sometimes, and Usually). 
Data cleaning and analysis for this project was done using SQL.  

My analysis aimed to uncover national and state-specific trends in HCAHPS performance on measures like communication with doctors, medication information, discharge processes, and overall satisfaction. I leveraged this robust data source to provide insights into successes and highlight areas needing improvement across regions, States, and Facilities.

At the National Level
•	The "Discharge Information" measure had the highest positive satisfaction score.
•	The "Communication about medicines" measure had the highest least positive satisfaction score which indicates the lowest satisfaction across the regions.
•	The West North Central Region had the highest Average Response rate score while the South Atlantic region had the lowest Average Response rate score.
•	The average response rate declined across the year indicating a decline in interest of Patients in the Survey participation.

At the State Level
•	The "Discharge Information" measure also had the highest most positive satisfaction score similar to the national level.
•	The "Communication about medicines" measure also had the highest least positive satisfaction score similar to the national level.
•	The last two States with the lowest average response rate throughout the years were New Jersey and Georgia.
•	Specifically, the District of Columbia was rated as the lowest-performing facility for Overall rating and hospital referral.

Key findings revealed regional variations in satisfaction, with the West North Central region having the highest average response rate compared to the lower South Atlantic average. At the state level, New Jersey and Georgia had the lowest response rates. Additionally, discharge information scored highest in satisfaction nationally, while communication about medications was the lowest.
To further improve experiences based on this analysis, I recommended targeted staff training on medication education and discharge processes should prioritized nationally and at the state level. Also, to further improve the response rate obtained per region, targeted programs such as incentives and campaigns should be introduced to motivate patients to participate in the survey, especially in the Pacific and South Atlantic regions, especially in Georgia and New Jersey. Specialized intervention should be provided to facilities in District Columbia as they were rated low in relation to overall hospital rating and referral. This project exemplified using data to guide initiatives that tangibly enhance patient centricity.
